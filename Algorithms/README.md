This course teaches a range of fundamental algorithms and analyses their complexity.
Algorithms are fundamental to all branches of computer science. They play a key role in the development of efficient computer programs. This course aims to provide a good understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithm design methods used for solving a wide range of problems.

A selection of topics from the following (non-exclusive) list is covered:
• Introduction to algorithmic thinking and design
• Analysis of algorithms (proof techniques, asymptotic notation)
• Divide & conquer: recursive design techniques and solving recurrences
• Greedy algorithms: Coin changing, Interval scheduling, Fractional knapsack, Huffman codes
• Dynamic programming: Top-down approach, Bottom-up enumeration, Optimal substructure, Optimal coin changing, Minimum cost path in grid, Multi-stage graphs, Unbounded knapsack, 0/1 knapsack, Edit distance, Longest common subsequence, Dynamic time warping
• Computational geometry: Convex hulls (properties, Gift-wrap algorithm, Graham-scan algorithm), Plane-sweep algorithms (closest pair, line intersections), Range search methods (kD trees, Quadtrees)
• Graphs: Topological ordering, Minimum spanning trees, Single-source and All-pair shortest paths
• Backtracking: combinatorial search and generation
• String matching: Rabin-Karp algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, Boyer-Moore algorithm.
