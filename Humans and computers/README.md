The designers of interactive computer systems create a language or dialogue that allows users to communicate with their systems. This language may take many forms, such as a text-based command-line interface, a graphical user interface with windows and buttons, or a 3D graphical visualisation. In this course you will learn how to design, implement, and evaluate different types of user-interfaces.
