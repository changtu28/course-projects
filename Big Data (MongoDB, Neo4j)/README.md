# Big Data Management
# Chang Tu 2021
Big Data Management is a comprehensive elective course of theoretical methods and engineering technology knowledge, which belongs to the middle and late period of the computer course series. Based on the knowledge of data structure, operating system and other courses, it tells the theory and technology of big data management in the field of data engineering. This course first summarizes the development of data management system, analyzes the inevitability of the development of big data management system, and starts from two dimensions of data model and system construction. In terms of data model, it mainly covers relational data model and SQL, key-value pair data model, document model and its query language, graph model and related SQL-like query language. In terms of system construction, it covers the system structure, storage and organization, query processing, transaction management and fault recovery of typical big data systems. This course guides students to understand the development trend of big data management, master relevant main methods and technologies, and cultivate students' ability to analyze and solve complex engineering problems in the context of big data.


#  Task descriptions:
The first task and the second task are mainly to perform experimental operations in MongoDB and Neo4j. (Please refer to the task book for details.)
The third task is to verify the MVCC multi-version concurrency control of MYSQL under the InnoDB storage engine for ACID characteristics of the transaction
The last task is to implement a function to add a new user in both MySQL and Neo4j, which needs to meet transaction consistency and also need to ensure that the added user has the same status in the above two databases.
