Big Data Management is a comprehensive elective course of theoretical methods and engineering technology knowledge, which belongs to the middle and late period of the computer course series. Based on the knowledge of data structure, operating system and other courses, it tells the theory and technology of big data management in the field of data engineering. This course first summarizes the development of data management system, analyzes the inevitability of the development of big data management system, and starts from two dimensions of data model and system construction. In terms of data model, it mainly covers relational data model and SQL, key-value pair data model, document model and its query language, graph model and related SQL-like query language. In terms of system construction, it covers the system structure, storage and organization, query processing, transaction management and fault recovery of typical big data systems. This course guides students to understand the development trend of big data management, master relevant main methods and technologies, and cultivate students' ability to analyze and solve complex engineering problems in the context of big data.
