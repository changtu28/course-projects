This course focuses on all aspects of fundamental computer graphics methods, including three-dimensional object representations, transformations, projections and rendering algorithms. The theoretical bases and implementation aspects of illumination and reflection models, texture mapping techniques and ray tracing are also covered. The course aims to provide a good foundation of OpenGL programming for the development of graphics applications using both fixed-function and programmable pipelines. The course also gives an introduction to WebGL programming.
